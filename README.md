# Android web installer

This is an easy-to-use web installer for Android-based operating systems that runs entirely in the browser. It uses WebUSB, which is supported by Chromium and its derivatives, and my [fastboot.js](https://github.com/kdrag0n/fastboot.js) library for flashing. This allows it to work on computers and Android devices software with no additional software or command-line tools.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you adapt this installer or make other improvements to it, please contribute the improvements back to the official repository instead of forking it and keeping the changes to yourself. There are many rough edges that need to be improved upon.
